Refactor functions: adventuer, counicl room, remodel, smithy, village

process: actually in this process, I did not use any particular way to 
refacte them. The first thing I did is to determin paraments for each 
function. Specifically, I need to understand which variable can be changed 
to local variable in this function and which variable only need to be 
passed from outside. Thus these functions do not have any differences with 
orignal codes.
