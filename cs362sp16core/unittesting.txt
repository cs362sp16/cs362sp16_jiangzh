3. I did not find any bugs after I done unit tests

4.  Accodring to results for each test after gcov, I find there is no 100% coverage 
	among results. I think it is normal, because we need to test the code is correct 
	or not, thus there should be two branchs exist in tests.

5. 	please type a command "make output", and then unittestresults.out will be created

6.	In general, unit testing is a good way to inspect small part of the programming, the
 	The advantages of unit testing is that it can quickly and accurately seek probles in
	a small part. And it will not be effacted by other codes in programming. So in this 
	assignment, unit testing help me understand how to separate a programing, and to test
	each parts.
