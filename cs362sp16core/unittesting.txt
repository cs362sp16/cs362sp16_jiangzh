3.  	In my unit tests, I just find one bug from cardtest2. Other unit tests did not
	find any bug. The bug is that player gains wrong number of cards after use a 
	active card.

4.  	Accodring to results for each test after gcov, I find there is no 100% coverage 
	among results. Average coverage of these tests is about 70% to 80%.  I think it 
	is normal, because we need to test the code is correct or not, thus there should 
	be two branchs exist in tests. Some branchs cannot be executed by program if the 
	test is successful.

5. 	please type a command "make output", and then unittestresults.out will be created

6.	In general, unit testing is a good way to inspect small part of the programming, the
 	The advantages of unit testing is that it can quickly and accurately seek problems in
	a small part. And it will not be effacted by other codes in programming. So in this 
	assignment, there are many functions and files. If we do not use unit test, it will 
	be hard for seeking bug in this complex program. Unit testing help me understand how 
	to separate a programing, and to test each parts. We do not need to think about all 
	details in this game. We just need to focus on the effect of the function we test and 
	compare results.
