I used 18, 31 and 78 as seed to complete this differential testing. Most of results I gain is "TEST PASSED". As for "TEST FAILED" results, I think the cause of creating differences is that there are many random testing in testdominion.c. These random testing will create different value such as number of players. So I think these differences are reasonable.

After I compared my dominion implementation and my classmate Wenbo Hou. I get "TEST FAILED", and our coverage is 81.88% and 81.89% respectively. I think it is possible that using this way to find some errors in dominion.c, because if we find a difference in somewhere, so it probably means there is a error in either of them. But actually it is not an dieal case for differential testing. There are two reason, first one is that this testing is also random testing, so which means that testdominion will use different value to test these dominion implementation and then create different results. Second reason is that we cannot determine whice one is correct althouht we can find differentces.
