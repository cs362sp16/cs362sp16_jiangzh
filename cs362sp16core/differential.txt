First of all, as for my dominion.c, it runs for 10 times and the coverage is more than 80%, so I think my 
testdominion.c is useful to do testing. Next, I used 18, 31 and 78 as seed to complete this differential 
testing by differential.sh. Most of results I gain is "TEST PASSED". I still gain a few of "TEST FAILED" 
results, but I think the cause of creating differences is that here are many random testing in testdominion.c. 
These random testing will create different value such as number of players. So I think these differences 
are reasonable.

After I compared my dominion implementation and my classmate Wenbo Hou. I get "TEST FAILED", and our coverage 
is 81.88% and 81.89% respectively. I think it is possible that using this way to find some errors in dominion.c, 
because if we find a difference in somewhere, so it probably means there is a error in either of them. But actually 
it is not an ideal case for differential testing. There are two reason, first one is that this testing is also random 
testing, so which means that testdominion will use different value to test these dominion implementations and then 
create different results. Second reason is that we cannot determine which one is correct although we can find differences.
