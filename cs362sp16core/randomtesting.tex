According to results of these three random test. The coverage is 100% for each card. I set 2000 as times for making
loop, and time I took is about 5 seconds for completing all tests. It is obvious that random test has higher coverage
than unit test. The cause of this difference between them is that random test can check all conditions for a card or a 
function, in the other words, it can cover all branches. As for unit test, usually we merely set a fixed value or parament
to implement test, so this way would cause that some branches are ignored. So in my opinion, I tend to believe that random
test has better fault detection capability.
