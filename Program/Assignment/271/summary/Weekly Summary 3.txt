CS 271Zhi Jiang25/01/2015In this week, I read chapter 7 for this textbook, and I learned how to use assembly language to write program. I think this is a real start.First of all, we have to define three sections, which are data, text and bss. Each section has different function. The data section is used to hold named variable that has initial value. The text section is used to hold program code. Code will be used when program runs. The bss section is similar with data section, but it holds uninitialized value. In assembly language, there is a most common activity is transform data here to there. So we have to use MOV instruction. MOV can take data from one register into memory, or one memory into register. And then, I understand a special data, which is immediate data. Because it is not in register, and it is not stored any memory. Only the source operand may be immediate data. I find a very important thing is we should notice size of each data, register and memory. Because different size of register and memory sometimes has conflicts when we use instruction MOV. I also learned a new thing, which is flag. A flag is a one bit of information. And there are many kinds of flag such as OF, DF, IF and TF. Each kind of flag can play different role. For example, trap flag can allows debuggers to manage single-stepping. I also learned operand symbols. Take an example, r8 is an 8 bit register half and r16 is a 16 bit general-purpose register.
